# Web Streams API Learning Resource

The primary goal of this repository is to provide examples and educational content for developers interested in exploring the Web Streams API. 

This repository is a learning resource and should not be used as a reference for best practices, especially concerning the testing examples provided.
The code is intended to be educational and may not be suitable for production use.

## Usage

Feel free to clone this repository and explore the code to get a hands-on experience with the Web Streams API. However, be aware that the code and tests included here are meant for learning purposes only.

## Testing

In this repository, we have utilized Vitest and MSW (Mock Service Worker) as learning tools to demonstrate how to use fixtures through contexts.
While these tools are powerful and useful for creating test environments, the tests in this repository are simplified and may not follow the best practices for production-level code.
